         <p class="feature-text">
            I am currently working as an electronic engineer in an ice cream factory. My goal is to learn something new
            for myself, and if there is an opportunity to change my occupation. Before that I studied programming
            languages, which are very similar to JS, ​​at the university. At the first place of work, I had to learn a
            new language for me - step 7, which isn't like one of those that were at the university. And now, learning
            JS, I remember the previously accumulated "<span class="text-italic">knowledge base</span>", and it brings
            me pleasure.

         <p class="feature-text">
            I try to learn English in every possible way. Smartphone: Simpler, Duolingo. I use google translate a lot.
            But it happens when I can read the text “<span class="text-italic">between the lines</span>” and understand
            the meaning. Passed the test, showed A2.
